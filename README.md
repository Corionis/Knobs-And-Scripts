# KAS : Knobs And Scripts
Knobs And Scripts is a utility to save, restore, and optionally 
version Linux settings (knobs) and scripts. Originally written to 
make rebuilding a system and sharing configurations easier KAS may 
be used at the system or user level.

KAS uses a local 
directory to save a list of files and/or directories along with 
their paths and permissions. That directory 
may optionally be versioned to a git or GitHub repository.
